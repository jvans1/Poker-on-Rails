2. Lesson: Position is everything
  Winnings per position => % hands played per position
  Handhistory.select("sum(netamountwon) as winnings").group("positiontype_id")
3. Winnings per player/how many people i've won from

Questions 
Handhistory.select("pokerhand_id, sum(evnetwon) as winnings").group("pokerhand_id") slow
 Handhistory.select("day, sum(bbwon) as winnings").group("day").order("day").map{|h| h.winnings.to_i/100.0} fast

 tyring to get Handhistory.first.hand => compares to pokerhand_id not holecardvalue_id
